##Lesson Plan

###Pre-requisites
This lesson will include the use of regular expressions which were covered in '[Library Carpentry Week One: Introduction to Data](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-data-intro/blob/master/lesson-materials/LibCarp-introtodata.md)'. However, there are no pre-requisites in terms of skills or knowledge required to complete this lesson.

_____
### Installation (to be completed before the session)

####Downloading OpenRefine
You can download OpenRefine from http://openrefine.org/download.html. There are two versions you can use for this lesson:

* Google Refine 2.5
* OpenRefine 2.6 - Development version (beta 1)

Generally OpenRefine 2.6 is recommended and although labelled ‘beta’ has been stable for some time. However, note that the 2.6 beta does not work with Internet Explorer.

There are versions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

####Installing and Running OpenRefine
When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you simply unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a "local" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.

If you are downloading OpenRefine for Mac, you a re downloading a ‘dmg’ (disk image) file which you can open, and then drag the OpenRefine application to an appropriate folder on your computer.

OpenRefine is a java application, and you need to have a ‘java runtime environment’ (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from http://java.com by going to the site and clicking ‘Free Java Download’.

To run Refine:

* On Windows: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine and either double-click ‘google-refine.exe’ (for Google Refine 2.5), ’openrefine.exe’ (for OpenRefine 2.6) or ‘refine.bat’ (for either)
* On Linux: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine in a terminal window and type ‘./refine’
* On Mac: Navigate to where you installed OpenRefine and click the OpenRefine icon

The interface to OpenRefine is accessed via a web browser. When you run Refine normally this should open a window in your default web browser pointing at the address http://127.0.0.1:3333. If this doesn’t happen automatically you can open a web browser and type in this address.

####Getting Help
If you encounter problems installing or running OpenRefine, a good source of support is [the OpenRefine mailing list and forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine)

If you are installing OpenRefine on Windows, you may want to check the thread on [Installing OpenRefine on Windows 7](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/openrefine/64-bit%7Csort:date/openrefine/vUzqJqJ-sAA/Tb2Om9wvaqgJ)
